Data-driven nearest-neighbors models to predict physical experiments in
silicon-based lithium-ion battery anodes.

In order to improve certain aspects of the materials, it is necessary to have 
an in-depth understanding of the physics of the processes involved. In the 
intrinsic behavior of silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries, two 
contributions are always observed in different experiments that have not yet 
been elucidated. These models attempt to better interpret these peculiarities.
